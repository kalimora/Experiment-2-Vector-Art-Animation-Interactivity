# Experiment 2: Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity

This project is part of **Experiment 2: Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity**, an assignment completed for **CMPM 169: Creative Coding**.

## Project Description
This project explores generative art and interactivity through the use of vector-based graphics, animated entities, and dynamic user input. The result is an interactive visual simulation where users can toggle between straight and curved lines to create flowing patterns.

## How to Use
- **Mouse Click**: Toggles between straight lines and flowing, curved lines.
- **Interaction**: Watch as entities draw smooth, pulsing paths on the canvas.
